# QuanChain
This repository is for collecting documents to be submitted for the Blaise Pascal Quantum Challenge.

## Overview
Quanchain leverages Quantum Artificial Intelligence (Quantum AI) to transform supply chain management, aligning it with the principles of the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By integrating cutting-edge quantum computing techniques, we aim to optimise logistics, reduce waste, and foster a greener, more efficient global supply chain ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Quantum Optimisation:** Solve complex supply chain problems (e.g., routing, inventory management) with quantum algorithms.
- **Sustainability Goals Alignment:** Directly contributes to SDGs such as responsible consumption and production and climate action.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Leverages machine learning models to predict demand and optimise resources.
- **Transparency and Traceability:** Incorporates blockchain technology for secure and auditable supply chain operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Quantum Computing:** Qiskit, D-Wave Ocean SDK
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, or Node.js
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
